### Portfolio Analytics Team Lead
- Company: Jumo.world
- Jun 2019 - May 2021

Key Points:
- Deep data analytics to aid portfolio, and asset managers in making data driven decisions, and provide statistical confidence (or risk) to the business problem and its possible solutions.
- Client behavioral analytics to gain an extensive understanding in how the product is used, and which behaviors lead to predictable client performance outcomes.
- Machine learning and visualization to build insight into our massive datasets.
- Develop learnings to guide strategy and product development.
- Innovate, question the status quo, find contradictions, and raise non-obvious questions. 
- Guide a small team of Data Scientists to enhance technical quality, ability and R&D outcomes.
- Anomaly detection to discover and address spurious behavior (either through better product fit or declines).

### Senior Data Scientist
- Company: MyBucks
- Jun 2018 - May 2019

Key points:
- Data Science system owner for the Haraka unsecured mobile loans product.
- Developed a modern data pipeline starting from the android app on the client's phone, through an API into our systems to features stored in our database. This pipeline allowed for realtime scaling to deal with load fluctuations, data cleaning, pre-processing and feature computation. The pipeline significantly reduced operating costs, made the system easier to service and improve through modularity, while maintaining the 5 second upper limit between applying for a loan and getting a qualifying response.
- Used deep dive data analytics to translate data into actionable business insights. Identified a fraud ring that was costing the company upwards of a R1m per month, and used that analysis to develop features and algorithms that halted the fraud completely (using a combination of graph databases and machine learning models). 
- Developed a dashboard and internal system probes that monitor trends and real-time metrics of Machine Learning model performance, data drift, text parser staleness, anomalous activity, fraudulent client behavior, system error rates, and traffic. This reduced our response time to system issues from months (when a client noticed and reported it) to days.

### Senior Systems Engineer
- Company: CSIR
- Jan 2014 - May 2018

Key Points: 
- New system design of a reactive radar jammer that surveys the electromagnetic environment, measures signals within the environment, determines the threat of the emitter as well as its location, classifies the emitter and applies state of the art counter-measure techniques. 

Additional experience:
- Team member (8 individuals) of business area (50+ individuals) strategy focus group.
- Team member (12 individuals) of competency area (100+ individuals) technology innovation leadership team.
- Engineering tech lead on international proposals and client negotiations.

### Data Analyst (Digital Signals)
- Company: CSIR
- Jan 2010 - May 2018

Key Points:
