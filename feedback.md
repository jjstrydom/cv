Certainly! As a hypothetical hiring manager for the Chief Data Officer or Chief Analytics Officer role, here are some potential gaps or areas of concern I might identify:

1. Strategic Leadership at Scale: While the candidate has held leadership roles, it's not clear how large these teams were. For a Chief-level role, experience in leading large departments or divisions, preferably in multi-national or large-scale settings, would be beneficial.

1. Enterprise-Level Data Strategy: There is ample experience in executing data projects, but the CV does not strongly highlight strategic planning and vision-setting for an entire organization's data infrastructure and strategy.

1. Stakeholder Management: The CV doesnâ€™t emphasize experience in managing relationships or communicating with C-level executives, board members, or external partners. This skill is crucial for top leadership roles.

1. Change Management: There's no clear indication of experience in leading major organizational changes, such as data transformation initiatives or integrating data strategy post-mergers and acquisitions.

1. Budgeting and Resource Allocation: At the C-level, understanding how to manage and allocate resources (budget, tools, staff) for maximum impact is essential. This skill is not apparent in the CV.

1. Regulatory & Compliance: Experience with data privacy, security, governance, and regulatory compliance (like GDPR) is not explicitly mentioned. This knowledge is crucial for chief data roles, especially in industries like finance and healthcare.

1. Industry Depth: While the candidate has diverse industry experience, if the hiring company operates in a specific industry (e.g., healthcare, retail), there might be concerns about the candidate's depth of industry-specific knowledge.

1. Continued Education: While there's a mention of specific courses, a continual demonstration of staying updated with the latest trends in data science and leadership, such as recent certifications or trainings, might add value.

1. Global Experience: While there's mention of operating across multiple territories, a clearer emphasis on global leadership experience, including challenges faced and strategies developed for international markets, could be beneficial.

1. Innovation & R&D: Although there is mention of R&D in the roles, emphasizing a track record of driving innovation that led to business growth or opened new revenue streams would be a plus.

It's essential to note that these gaps are highlighted from the perspective of a typical C-level role in a large organization. Jurgen Strydom's CV is impressive, and these points are not deficiencies but areas that could be addressed or highlighted more prominently depending on the specific expectations of the hiring company.
